# Policy 
I want to keep Easy-ISLisp as small and simple as possible.

I was a fan of Scheme. It was around R3RS ~ R5RS. I fell in love with Scheme's simple and elegant design philosophy. 
However, after R6RS, Scheme changed its policy to become huge. 
I hated the recent huge Scheme. 

Around that time, I learned about the ISLisp standard. It is very simple and compact. I fell in love with this. 
For this reason I want to keep Easy-IS Lisp as small and simple as possible.
