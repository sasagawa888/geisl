# Module
The ISLisp standard has no modules.
I tried to extend ISLisp with reference to the Elixir module.
The compiler for Easy-ISLisp, which has thousands of lines, has also been changed to be managed by this module. 
For the time being, name conflicts are avoided. 

# specification

## defmodule

(defmodule module-name main body)
Give a symbol to the module name.
Everything specified by ISLisp can be described in the main body. defun, defglobal, defmacro, defgeneric, etc.
You can write a function called defpublic only in the module. This is a function definition, but it can be referenced externally.
Other function names etc. are converted like module name::function-name. 
For example, if you define a function called bar in a module called foo, the function name is foo::bar. 

## import

(import library-name)
The library name is given as a character string. 
Save the library created by using the f module in the library folder in advance. 
If there is a compiled one, it will be read preferentially. 

## defpublic
Only the functions defined by defpublic can be referenced from the outside. 

e.g. 

```

(defmodule foo
    (defglobal a 3)

    (defpublic bar (x)

        (+ (boo x) (gfib x)))

    (defun boo (x)
        (+ x a))

    (defpublic baz (x)
        (uoo x))

    (defmacro uoo (x)
        `(+ ,x ,x))


    (defgeneric gfib (n)
        (:method ((n <integer>)) (cond ((= n 1) 1)
                                       ((= n 2) 1)
                                       (t (+ (gfib (- n 1)) (gfib (- n 2)))) )))

    (defpublic fact (n)
        (if (= n 0)
            1
            (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
)

Function boo is private. The global variable declaration, (defglobal x n), is private and cannot be referenced from the outside. 
The same applies to dynamic variables (defdynamic x n).
